        <h2>CPU Scheduling Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
          CPU scheduling is an essential part of the operating system that determines which process should be executed by the CPU at a given time. Various scheduling algorithms, such as Round Robin, Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, and Multilevel Queue Scheduling, are used to manage the CPU's time and provide fair execution to processes.
