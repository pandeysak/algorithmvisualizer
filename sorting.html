      <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them
        if they are in the wrong order. It has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2).

      <h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less
        efficient on large lists compared to more advanced algorithms such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort. It has a worst-case and
        average-case time complexity of O(n^2).

      <h2>Selection Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Selection sort is a simple in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It has an average-case and worst-case time complexity
        of O(n^2).

      <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges
        the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array. It has an average-case and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

      <h2>Quick Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Quick sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning
        the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It has an average-case
        time complexity of O(n log n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).
