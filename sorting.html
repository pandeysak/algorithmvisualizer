    <p><strong>Bubblesort</strong> Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent
         elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case
          time complexity is quite high.</p>
        <p>Time complexity =O(n*n) in worst case</p>

       <div class="text"><p><strong>Insertionsort</strong> The idea behind the insertion sort is that first take one element, iterate it through 
        the sorted array. Although it is simple to use, it is not appropriate for large data sets as the time complexity of insertion sort in the
         average case and worst case is O(n2), where n is the number of items. Insertion sort is less efficient than the other sorting algorithms
          like heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc.

        <div class="text"><p><strong>Selectionsort</strong>Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly 
            selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
            The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first
             element of the unsorted portion. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion of the list until the entire list is sorted
           divide the search space in half. </p>

        <div class="text"><p><strong>Mergesort</strong> Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an 
            array into smaller subarrays,sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to
             form the final sorted array. </p>

            <div class="text"><p><strong>Quicksort</strong> QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element 
                as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort
                 that pick pivot in different ways. 

                ->Always pick the first element as a pivot.
                ->Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
                ->Pick a random element as a pivot.
                ->Pick median as the pivot.</p>
